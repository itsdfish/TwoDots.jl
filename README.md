# TwoDots

The goal of TwoDots is to earn as many points as possible by connecting dots of the same color. If the connected dots form a rectangle, all of the dots of that color count towards your points. Click on the dots you want to connect and click submit. 

# Example

```julia
using TwoDots
start()
```

# Additional Features

In TwoDots.jl, the game and GUI components are designed to be modular. This allows the game to be played by a simulated agent with an optional GUI. Please see [TwoDotsModels.jl](https://github.com/itsdfish/TwoDotsModels.jl) for a simple example of building a simulated agent for the game TwoDots.
