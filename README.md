# TwoDots

The goal of TwoDots is to earn as many points as possible by connecting dots of the same color. If the connected dots form a rectangle, all of the dots of that color count towards your points. Click on the dots you want to connect and click submit.

using TwoDots
game = Game()
gui = generate_gui(game)
```
